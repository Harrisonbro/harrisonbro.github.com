				<ul>
					<li><strong>Page objectives:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Tell the visitors exactly what Designs In Wood <em>actually</em> does</li>
					<li>Convey what Designs In Wood can offer the customer that others cannot; your unique selling point.</li>
					<li>To make visitors feel comfortable with the company and develop a feeling of personal connection</li>
					<li>Signpost visitors to other sections of the site to read more details about some aspect of Designs In Wood</li>
				</ul></li>
					<li><strong>Priority content:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Message:</strong> Emphasise the personal nature of Designs In Wood&#8217;s process</li>
					<li><strong>Method:</strong> Mention the size of the company, the passion of the people involved, what your motivation is (ie. getting excited about improving someone&#8217;s home, etc). Talk a little about the design process</li>
					<li><strong>Call to action:</strong> Link through to <a href="design-process.html">design process page</a> to read more about what it&#8217;s like working with Designs In Wood</li>
					<li><strong>Assets:</strong> Photos of the main staff members interactive with customers (preferably in a kitchen with some planning documents, or in the showroom. <em>Not</em> just a standard front-facing mugshot!)</li>
				</ul></li>
					<li><strong>Secondary content:</strong> Tell the visitor what Designs In Wood does in no less than one paragraph (with a second or third going into more detail if appropriate). This is likely to come first on the page, but probably isn&#8217;t the primary objective of the page as it doesn&#8217;t generate a lot of value. Needs to lead visitors onto reading more detail about what your unique selling point is and what you offer better than competitors</li>
					<li><strong>Tertiary content:</strong> Contact details with call to action to get in touch <span style="display:block;font-size:0.9em;">Maybe saying something like &#8220;We&#8217;d love to work with you â€” if you&#8217;d think we&#8217;d be a good fit for you, get in touch to talk through how we might work together&#8221;</span></li>
					<li><strong>Quaternary content:</strong> Links to other sections of the site, either with inline links (such as &#8220;read more about <a href="kitchens--furniture.html">our furniture</a>&#8220;) or distinct sub-sections summarising and linking to other sections. This is useful because some visitors may get to your website and immediately click on <em>About Us</em>, expecting that to be a good place to find out more about your company. We don&#8217;t want to rely on them thinking to use the main navigation menu which is at the top of the website, fairly far away (conceptually, as well as physically) from the content they are reading.<br />

				<h1>About Us</h1>
			
				<p>Designs In Wood is a small family joinery company in Great Bentley.</p>
			
				<p>We build each cupboard by hand in our Essex workshop using mostly traditional joinery methods whilst embracing a level of modern methods to assist us with efficiency and costs.</p>
			
				<p>We draw on ideas from 18th and 19th century English Furniture.  The characteristics of our cupboards are quite plain and simple.  Any mouldings used are a subtle compliment not an overstatement.</p>
			
				<p>We don&#8217;t like the &#8216;fully-fitted&#8217; look but understand the need for key working areas.</p>
			
				<p>We do think there is a place for modern interior fittings; it doesn&#8217;t have to be a contest between past and present.</p>
			
				<p>We work closely with our customer&#8217;s every step of the way from the initial meeting through to fitting.  Each project is individual, no production line, no hundred&#8217;s made at a time.  Any questions, queries or concerns come straight through to us. </p>
			
				<p>So we can meet the resources of every individual, whilst remaining fully committed to delivering a quality product, we have developed our &#8216;<span class="caps">MADE</span> <span class="caps">SIMPLE</span>&#8217; Range of furniture.</p>
			
				<p>Although we are based in Essex we have completed projects in many other counties.</p>
