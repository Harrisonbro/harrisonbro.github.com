					<li><strong>Page objectives:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>To create desire for the bespoke and <em>personal</em> design process (convey its value);</li>
					<li>Reassure them that they don&#8217;t need experience and expertise to enjoy a bespoke experience;</li>
					<li>Address question of &#8220;why is this better than an [IKEA/Magnet/Homebase/etc] kitchen?&#8221;</li>
				</ul></li>
					<li><strong>Priority content:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Message:</strong> We want to be involved in your goals and dreams for your home, and the design/consultation process is easy but effective.</li>
					<li><strong>Method:</strong> Hammer home (reiterate) the fact that Designs In Wood are passionate about <em>your home</em> and want you to have a great experience.</li>
				</ul></li>
					<li><strong>Secondary content:</strong> Describe the actual design process. Might want to have some graphic laying out the process (sort of like: ① → ② → ③ → ④ ) as a more interesting way of telling the story of how you take clients from consultation to delivery.</li>
					<li><strong>Tertiary content:</strong> Assure visitors that bespoke doesn&#8217;t have to cost lots and Designs In Wood will work with whatever budget they have [possible section title: &#8220;Bespoke doesn&#8217;t have to mean expensive.&#8221;]</li>
					<li><strong>Quaternary content:</strong> Assure visitors Designs In Wood is still passionate about smaller rooms or sections of your house, so are a good company to work with even for smaller jobs [possible section title: &#8220;Don&#8217;t want to rebuild a whole room? No problem.&#8221;]</li>

				<h1>Our Process</h1>
			
				<p>Of course, the essence of a room will always dictate the type of furniture needed but there are other factors, not always obvious, that should be taken in to consideration. </p>
			
				<p>The way light enters the room and how it changes throughout the day, highlighting the importance of the colour palate.</p>
			
				<p>How the furniture will appear from different aspects of the house; through a sitting room door, looking along a hallway or the view through a window as approached from the garden, terrace or driveway.  And although built for the present how will the design work for the future.  </p>
			
				<p>When familiar with your surroundings these small observations may be overlooked but help to assist with the development of any room.</p>
			
				<p>The room may still be in the planning stage.  This is an ideal time to start exploring the furniture layout.  It may lead to changes in door and window positioning also interior fixtures and fittings such as electric sockets, light switches or the way an entry door is hinged.</p>
			
				<p>Each Plan is drawn by hand and although computer generated design is a popular way to deliver a room layout, working, developing and presenting ideas using pen and paper is an effective method as it helps to build a level of familiarity with a project. </p>
			
				<p>It&#8217;s a myth you cannot introduce period furniture to a modern house or contemporary furniture to a period property.  We know because we&#8217;ve done it.</p>
			
				<p>It is for us to develop an understanding of individual&#8217;s expectations, draw ideas from the surroundings and transfer into the design.    </p>
