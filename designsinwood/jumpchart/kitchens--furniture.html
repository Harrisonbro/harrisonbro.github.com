				<h1>Our Kitchens &amp; Furniture</h1>
			
				<p>We have cherry picked ideas and practices from both traditional and modern furniture making to use in way we build our cupboards.</p>
			
				<p>Our cupboard fronts, door frames, drawers, interior racking and pull out storage are made from a solid hard wood.  Our doors are fitted in traditional cabinetry style on butt hinges.  Our drawers are dovetailed and run on modern soft self closing runners.  We are equally at home making and fitting drawers that run on candle waxed wooden runners. </p>
			
				<p>We are not fixed on making everything.  If you have an existing piece of furniture you wish to be incorporated into a design, a Dresser, an Armoire or maybe a reclaimed Butcher&#8217;s Block.  You may simply want to extend your existing arrangement with some new cupboards or introduce a new individual one off piece, a Larder or Work Trolley.  We remain totally flexible.</p>
			
				<p>We have been asked to design and build bookcases for sitting rooms, window seats for bedrooms, entrance doors and once a reproduction porch canopy.   Joinery methods can be applied to all areas of furniture; it&#8217;s the designs that change &#8216;AT <span class="caps">HOME</span>&#8217;</p>
