					<li><strong>Section objective:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>To give a space on the site to talk in more depth about the process you used with real customers and what you delivered</li>
					<li>To have somewhere to house <em>specific</em> sections of content that highlight certain skills and qualities of Designs In Wood <br />
			<span style="font-size:0.8em;">[eg. you might write a case study of a very small kitchen you furnished where you show how Designs In Wood helped create a usable work area out of a small space. This can then be linked to from other places on the site with links saying things like &#8220;See how we turned a small kitchen into a beautiful, usable work space in Dave &amp; Jane&#8217;s home Â»&#8221;]</span></li>
					<li>To generate fresh, changing content (by adding/updating case studies regularly) that is full of keywords for <span class="caps">SEO</span> purposes (Search Engine Optimisation)<br />
